title: AP Rogue and WIPS
---

In this blog I talk about Rogues APs and WIPS, and how works on my Cisco Lab.

In the next topology, you can see my lab. I have a VirtualC9800, and two APs C9120 on Flex Mode associte with it, the SSID that I use is "LAB-WIFI". On the right I have a WLC3504, with only one AP 3702, and configure the same SSID "LAB-WIFI".
